## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **System Prompting**  
   The backend sends Sonar a prompt that combines your topic (and optional theme) with instructions to fetch source-backed facts and format them as a single storyboard panel.

2. **Page-by-Page Generation**  
   Sonar returns one narrative segment and its ‚Äúimage prompt‚Äù per request. We repeat this cycle for the specified number of pages to assemble the full story.

3. **Image Synthesis**  
   Each image prompt is sent to the AI model (Imagen + OpenAI GPT-1) to generate matching artwork.

4. **Final Output**  
   You get a complete, illustrated five-panel anime narrative‚Äîboth entertaining **and** factually accurate.
